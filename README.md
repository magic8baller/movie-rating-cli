# Creating a List of Movie Ratings on the CLI
A restructured version of Code Academy's "Night At The Movies" Ruby project:

It allows users to use the CLI to manipulate a list of movies and their ratings.
It provides options to add movies, update their ratings, display the current list, and delete a movie.
-Easily customizable, the code can be reused to perform basic user manipulations for any list topics.


I have taken CodeAcademy's code and broken it up into helper methods, making the program usable outside of the CodeAcademy app.
